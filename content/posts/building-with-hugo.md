Hugo is an incredibly fast static site generator written in Go. Here's why I chose it for my blog:

## Speed and Simplicity {#speed-and-simplicity}

Hugo is blazingly fast. It can build thousands of pages in milliseconds, which makes the development experience smooth and enjoyable.

## Markdown Support {#markdown-support}

One of the best features of Hugo is its native support for Markdown. This makes writing content:
- Natural and intuitive
- Easy to version control
- Portable across different platforms

## Easy Deployment {#easy-deployment}

Because Hugo generates static files, deploying the site is as simple as copying files to a web server.
