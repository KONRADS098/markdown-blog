# Context Engineering Series Organization

## Structure

This series uses Hugo's **cascade frontmatter** to share common series metadata across all posts.

```
content/thoughts/context-engineering-series/
├── _index.md              ← Series metadata (cascades to all children)
├── 01-signal-bottleneck/
│   └── index.md
├── 02-the-stack/
│   └── index.md
└── 03-start-simple/
    └── index.md
```

## How It Works

### `_index.md` (Series Parent)
Defines shared metadata that automatically applies to all posts in the folder:

```toml
[cascade]
  series = "Context Engineering"
  series_color = "#0984e3"
```

### Individual Posts
Only need to define their unique metadata:

```toml
title = "Signal Is the Bottleneck"
date = "2025-11-02T10:00:00+01:00"
series_order = 1
# series and series_color are inherited from _index.md!
```

## Benefits

✅ **No duplication** - Series name and color defined once  
✅ **Easy maintenance** - Update series metadata in one place  
✅ **Clear organization** - All series posts in one folder  
✅ **Numbered folders** - Folder names indicate order (01, 02, 03)

## Adding a New Post to the Series

1. Create a new folder: `04-new-post/`
2. Add `index.md` with just:
   ```toml
   title = "New Post Title"
   date = "2025-11-02T13:00:00+01:00"
   series_order = 4
   ```
3. Series name and color are automatically inherited!

## Creating a New Series

1. Create folder: `content/thoughts/new-series-name/`
2. Add `_index.md`:
   ```toml
   title = "New Series Name"
   [cascade]
     series = "New Series"
     series_color = "#00b894"  # Pick a new color
   ```
3. Add posts in numbered folders as above

## URL Structure
